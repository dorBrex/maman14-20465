# maman14-20465 - final score is 96, got some unused functions and not efficient cases... not gonna fix it..
The final project of Assembler in C (without the linker and loader) course-20465 at the Open University of Israel


This program elf (exe) file is called prog1
it's created from the files:
1. main.c
2. data.c
3. data.h
4. file_handler.c
5. file_handler.h
6. first_run.c
7. first_run.h
8. general_utils.c
9. general_utils.h
10.macro_handler.c
11. macro_handler.h
12. main.c
13. makefile
14. parsing_lines_to_binary.c
15. parsing_lines_to_binary.h
16. second_run.c
17. second_run.h

In order to create the prog1 elf file, you'll have to run the command 'make' which uses the 'makefile' to assemble and linkage the different 17 files into 1 exe file.
than in order to run the program you'll have to give it names of assembly files without the suffix of '.as':
'./prog1 <name_of_program_without_suffix_of_.as> <test>'
  
 The program is very detailed and explained well with comments and triple comments.
 Feel free to contact me.
